## Installation

- Starter code was cloned and a new repository was created, which was labeled as HoriSEOn-Project

- Restructured the style.css alphabetically, eliminated redundancies, and corrected selector names
- Tested and compared to original; my adjustments didn't effect how the application operated
- Uploaded it to the repository and deployed website:  [insertwebsite]
